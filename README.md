# About Me
I'm a master's student at the Kahlert School of Computing, University of Utah, focusing on data science research. Currently, I am harnessing the power of climate data to tackle real-world issues in different communities.

I am dedicated to utilizing the insights gained from data and research as catalysts for positive change. Through my journey in academia, I aspire to harness the power of information to contribute meaningfully to the betterment of our community and address pressing challenges with data-driven solutions.

## Education						       		
- M.S., Computer Science	| The University of Utah (_August 2023 - Present_)	 			        		
- B.Tech., Computer Science | Vellore Institute of Technology (_August 2019 - May 2023_)

## Work Experience
**Computer Vision Research Intern @ The Centre of Excellence for Road Safety (CoERS) – IIT Madras (_December 2022 - June 2023_)**
- Designed and built computer vision and artificial intelligence tools to help improve road safety on Indian roads.
- Trained and tested a deep learning YOLOv7 model (F1 score – 61.2%) on a large dataset (about 10,000 images) which contained over 34 classes (cars, buses, bikes, traffic signs, pedestrians, etc.). The model also uses image contours to help nighttime and low light detection.
- Integrated the CRAFT and PARSeq models to make a real-time scene text recognition pipeline. 

**Research Intern @ University of Ottawa - Mitacs Globalink Research Internship (_May 2022 - August 2022_)**
- Created a novel feature selection algorithm (RICE-VD) that addresses the class-imbalanced problem in high-dimensional datasets (more than 750 dimensions).
- Analyzed and implemented standard methods like ReliefF, Chi-Square and SVM-RFE on cleaned and pre-processed datasets.
- Evaluated results in terms of accuracy, F1 score, geometric mean and area under the curve (AUC) to show that the algorithm developed performs better than existing methods.

**Project Intern @ Samsung R & D Institute (_October 2020 - March 2021_)**
- Developed a classifier that can classify media titles (movie and song names) according to the language each title belongs to. This is necessary to generate appropriate pronunciations specific to a language when converting text to speech.
- Implemented natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques like N-Gram, SVM, Neural Networks, MuRIL, LSTMs, and Tokenization techniques and attained a maximum of 92% accuracy.
